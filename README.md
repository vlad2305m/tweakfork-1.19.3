1.19.3 hopefully soon.
Tweakfork is a fork of Masa/Maruhon's mod [Tweakeroo](https://github.com/maruohon/tweakeroo). Its basically the same thing, except with some small changes to make life a little bit easier. 

1. Multi-layer block break restriction -> can prevent you from making potholes in the ground when speedmining
2. Block break whitelist/blacklist restriction -> can prevent you from accidentally mining the wrong block and flooding your redstone
3. Block based right click whitelist/blacklist restriction -> can prevent you from accidentally placing water outside of cauldrons and flooding your redstone
4. Toggleable flexible block placement -> may save you from arthritis
5. Stacking flexible block placement -> apply rotation to adjacent/offset placements
6. tweakHideScoreboard -> may save your sanity when servers turn on sidebar scoreboards during big digs
7. disableClientBlockEvents -> stops client side piston lag
8. disableStructureRendering -> disables structure block rendering. (bounding box, etc)
9. Fixed afterClicker with accurate placement protocol -> so placing repeaters isn't pain
10. tweakDayCycleOverride -> Overrides the time of day client-side
11. tweakNoSneakSlowdown -> Doesnt slow you down when you sneak
12. tweakScaffoldPlace -> Place blocks in a similar way to how scaffold placing works.
13. disableNametags -> Disables nametag rendering for unobstrusive replays
14. disableBossBar -> Disables the boss bar rendering
15. chestMirrorFix -> Fixes wonky chest mirroring behavior (works with litematica).
16. lavaDestroyFix -> Fixes [MC-246465](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-246465).
17. tweakAfkTimeout -> Automatically disconnects you (or does command/send chat) when afk.
18. tweakWeatherOverride -> Overrides the weather client side
19. tweakContainerScan -> Scans containers and tells you how many items/types are in it. Useful for debugging storage tech.
    * Easily see which containers have items or not
    * Compile a list of all the items it found
    * Search the list and click to easily find the location of the items.
    * To use, set the `openItemList` hotkey in Hotkeys.
20. Selectively Visible Blocks -> Allows you to make nice replays/vids with transparent parts (Works with optifucked and sodium+iris). Selectively renders blocks depending on position based white/blacklists.
    * Lists.selectiveBlocksWhitelist and Lists.selectiveBlocksBlacklist -> strings encoding the white/blacklists. Format: `x,y,z|x2,y2,z2|...`
    * tweakAreaSelector -> allows you to add/remove selection from list easily with areaSelectionAddToList and areaSelectionRemoveFromList hotkeys. works in replay editor. Use areaSelectionOffset hotkey to offset selection box.
    * tweakSelectiveBlocksRendering -> Turns on selective block rendering with the lists. Turn on before you render replay.
    * tweakSelectiveBlocksRenderOutline -> Renders an outline over the listed positions. Allows you to see whats in the white/blacklists.
    * Generic.selectiveBlocksTrackPistons -> When enabled, the mod will track piston movements and update the position lists accordingly.
    * Generic.areaSelectionUseAll -> When enabled, the area selector will include air blocks.
    * Generic.selectiveBlocksNoHit -> When enabled, disables trace-hitting hidden blocks. (hint: can also use to build stuff in hard to reach places in survival mode)
    * Generic.selectiveBlocksHideEntities -> When enabled, selective block rendering will also hide entities.
    * Generic.selectiveBlocksHideParticles -> When enabled, selective block rendering will also hide particles.
21. Noteblock edit -> tune noteblocks without getting carpal tunnel
    * While looking at noteblock, press number keys to add the amount of notes. eg, for high F note 23, press 1 two times then press 3 (1 = 10, 0 = reset)
    * Use plus key to add 1, minus key to subtract 1. 
    * Press letter keys A-G to set notes by letter name (only when Configs.Generic.noteEditLetters is set to true). Use Tab to toggle octave.
